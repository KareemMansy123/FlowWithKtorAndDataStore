# FlowWithKtorAndDataStore
<h2>hello there !</h2>

<h2> welcome to new repo </h2>

<h3>here we will try to see example for Ktor library with Kotlin Flow thats the first and we will go on and add Data Store </h3>

<h4> <h2>Ktor</h2> is a client-server framework that helps us build applications in Kotlin. It is a modern asynchronous framework backed by Kotlin coroutines.

Ktor can be compared to network library such as OkHttp and Retrofit.

We can use Ktor to make HTTP network requests to an API to get the response back to an application. Adding networking capabilities to an application developed with a traditional UI toolkit or Jetpack Compose is straightforward with the Ktor Client.

One of the closest relatives of Ktor is Retrofit, which is also used to consume APIs in Android. Retrofit is a java based Android library that can be used to develop Android and iOS based applications. Nevertheless, the Retrofit implementation in these platforms remains different.

On the other hand, Ktor is an asynchronous HTTP client that runs on several platforms. Ktor client is designed for various platforms, such as Android, Native (iOS and desktop), JVM, and JavaScript. Ktor is built on Kotlin multi-platform mobile (KMM). This means you can create both iOS and Android applications with Kotlin and share a huge part of Kotlin code for both platforms.

The Kotlin multi-platform mobile uses Kotlin as the base code. With this, you have to use the Kotlin libraries if you want to share the code across Android and iOS. Ktor client is a Kotlin based library, thus making it easier to implement the KMM principles. </h4>

<h4> <h2>Kotlin Flow</h2> is a new stream processing API developed by JetBrains, the company behind the Kotlin language. It’s an implementation of the Reactive Stream specification, an initiative whose goal is to provide a standard for asynchronous stream processing. Jetbrains built Kotlin Flow on top of Kotlin Coroutines.

By using Flow to handle streams of values, you can transform data in complex multi-threaded ways, by writing just a small bit of code!

<h4>Data collections and streams.</h4>
  <h4>Synchronous and asynchronous API calls.</h4>
  <h4>Hot and cold data streams.</h4>
  <h4>Exception handling during flow processing.</h4>

<h4> <h2>DataStore</h2> is Google’s new and improved solution for persisting simple pieces of data by using either key-value pairs or protocol buffers for storing typed objects. It does so using Kotlin Coroutines and Flow to make all the transactions asynchronous, making all the data storing and fetching operations more performant and safe! It’s part of the Jetpack set of tools, so it’s also known as the Jetpack DataStore.

<h4>DStore simple key-value pairs to the Jetpack DataStore.</h4>
  <h4>Store more complex, typed data to the Jetpack DataStore.</h4>
  <h4>Hot and cold data streams.</h4>
  <h4>Migrate existing data from Shared Preferences to the Jetpack DataStore.</h4>
